# Baseball_Injury
## Final Project for Harvey Mudd CS35: Computer Science for Insight

### Incomplete

This repository is a brief synthesization of biographical, website ID, and injury information from Injury information is from 2015 onwards. I intend to update this every few months or so. 

The final dataset `injury` is formatted such that each row is an injury occurence. Players may show up multiple times (multiple injuries over).

The data used to create the final dataset is also included: `People` (and the edited `people1`), `master` from Crunchtime Baseball, and `sp_injury` from scraped Spotrac.com.

This data combines information from the Lahman dataset, IDs from Crunchtime Baseball, and injury information from Spotrac.com.
The individual datasets from both the Lahman set and Crunchtime Baseballas well as the Spotrac individual team injury information can be found at the links below.
